Security Notes

    The server prevents path traversal attacks by sanitizing requested file paths

    Make sure your media directory contains only intended media files to avoid exposing sensitive data

Troubleshooting

    No audio on some videos: Ensure codecs are supported by the browser/player.

    Playlist scrolling not working: Verify JavaScript console errors in your browser.

    Media files not found: Check media directory path and file permissions.
