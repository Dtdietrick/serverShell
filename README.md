[Your File Server HTML/UI]
    |
    |  ðŸ“¦ Launch button â†’ loads iframe:
    v
[WebRCade UI Shell (/webrcade/play/index.html)]
    |
    |  ðŸ“‚ Feed-based launch of GBA emulator:
    v
[GBA Emulator Core (/webrcade/play/app/gba/)]
    |
    |  ðŸ§  Exposes `window.wrc` + handles FS/Module
    |
    |  ðŸ’¾ Writes save data into MEMFS â†’ IDBFS
	

ðŸ§ª Debug Tips:
Use window.wrc.getSaveBlob().then(console.log) in browser console to verify save exists

Ensure window.FS.syncfs is defined inside the emulator iframe (after flush)


Security Notes

    The server prevents path traversal attacks by sanitizing requested file paths

    Make sure your media directory contains only intended media files to avoid exposing sensitive data

Troubleshooting

    No audio on some videos: Ensure codecs are supported by the browser/player.

    Playlist scrolling not working: Verify JavaScript console errors in your browser.

    Media files not found: Check media directory path and file permissions.
